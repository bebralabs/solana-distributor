## How to Use:

### 1. Install Solana CLI
Ensure that you have the Solana CLI installed on your system. Refer to the official guide for installation: [Solana CLI Installation](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

### 2. Install Python
Download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to add Python to the "PATH" during installation.

### 3. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
pip3 install base58
```

### 4. Connect Your Wallet to Solana CLI
There are a few ways to connect your wallet:
- Place your Solana wallet private key in the same folder as the script, saved as `key.json`. Then run:
  ```bash
  solana config set -k key.json
  ```
- If you don't have a `.json` keypair, run the connector script with:
  ```bash
  python3 connector.py <private_key>
  ```
  This script will generate a `key.json` file and automatically link it to the CLI.

### 5. Prepare the Recipient List
Create a CSV file named `send.csv` with the following format:
```csv
address,amount
EgKPanaYKEyFs1c91aNfqdXQeFJoAFKe2VVBHxSGSEV6,0.1
ACLwGYEoKZQej6aUJ8eM811YkjRwfvY4AiEsMTqKGNuh,1.5
```

### 6. Run the Script
Execute the script using the following command:
```bash
python3 send.py
```

### 7. Monitor Progress
The script will display real-time updates in the terminal, showing the status of each transfer. It also generates a file named `result.csv`, which logs the outcome of each transaction with the following fields:
- `address`
- `amount`
- `status` (`Success` or `Failed`)

---

**Tips for Use**:
- üí° Always double-check the recipient addresses in the `send.csv` file to ensure accuracy.
- üîí Keep your wallet keys secure and never share them publicly.
